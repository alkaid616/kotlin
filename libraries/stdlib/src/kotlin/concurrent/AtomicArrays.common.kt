 * An [IntArray] in which elements are always updated atomically with guaranteed sequential consistent ordering.
 *
 * Platform-specific implementation details:
 *
 * For Native:
 * [AtomicIntArray] stores an [IntArray] and atomically updates it's elements.
 * For additional details about atomicity guarantees for reads and writes see [kotlin.concurrent.Volatile].
 *
 * For JVM:
 * When targeting the JVM, instances of [AtomicIntArray] are represented by [java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicIntegerArray].
 *
 * For JS and Wasm:
 * [AtomicIntArray] is implemented trivially since these platforms do not support multi-threading.
